# 🗺️ Implementation Plan: Archive Duplicate Finder Evolution

This document outlines the roadmap to transform **Archive Duplicate Finder** from a CLI tool into an advanced 3D-aware asset management system.

---

## 🛠️ Phase 1: Performance & Persistence (Foundation)
*Focuses on Point 6 and prepares the ground for caching.*

### 1.1 Local Database Integration (SQLite) - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Objective:** Avoid re-scanning files that haven't changed.
- **Implemented:** `internal/db` with fingerprinting and similarity caching.

### 1.2 File System Watcher
- **Objective:** Real-time background indexing.
- **Tasks:**
  - Integrate `fsnotify` to monitor the target directory.
  - Automatically queue new or modified archives for analysis in a low-priority background worker.

---

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Advanced Fingerprinting & Content Intelligence
*Focuses on Points 2 and 4.*

### 2.1 Geometry Voxel Hashing
- **Objective:** Identify models that are geometrically the same despite different file formats or minor scaling/rotation.
- **Tasks:**
  - Normalize STL coordinates (Translate to origin, Scale to unit cube).
  - Quantize space into a 32x32x32 grid (Voxels).
  - Generate a hash based on occupied voxels ("Voxel Hash").

### 2.2 Content Analyzer + Render Discovery - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Objective:** Better understanding of archive contents.
- **Implemented:**
  - **Render Extractor:** Automatically searches for and extracts the **largest** image file (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`) inside archives to use as a high-quality preview thumbnail.
  - Smart image detection across ZIP, RAR, and 7Z formats.
- **Pending:**
  - Improved multi-volume detection (verify if `part1` to `partN` are all present).

---

## 🛠️ Phase 3: Extended Cleanup Features
*Focuses on Point 5.*

### 3.1 "Safe Move" & Trash Logic - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Objective:** Reduce the risk of data loss.
- **Implemented:** `--trash` and `--ref` flags, integrated with Dashboard and CLI.

---

## 🛠️ Phase 4: Web Dashboard & Visual Excellence
*Focuses on Point 1.*

### 4.1 Embedded Web Server - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Objective:** A premium visual interface.
- **Implemented:** Next.js Dashboard with Go Fiber backend, Search, Filters, and Hover Previews.

### 4.2 Interactive 3D Comparison
- **Objective:** Visual verification before deletion.
- **Tasks:**
  - Integrate `Three.js` (React Three Fiber) in the web UI.
  - Allow users to "overlay" two STL models in 3D to see differences (Ghosting / Heatmap).

---

## 📈 Success Metrics
- **Performance:** Scan time for 10% change in directory should be <5 seconds (cached).
- **Accuracy:** Identify >95% of duplicates even with renamed files.
- **Aesthetics:** Web dashboard should feel like a premium professional asset manager.
